# Confronting transitions in fishery fleet structure and selectivity: Practical recommendations for integrated age-structured stock assessments based on simulation analysis

Fisheries can experience dynamic shifts in fleet structure, gear usage, and selectivity, presenting challenges for stock assessment. Failing to adequately incorporate variation in fishery dynamics within stock assessment models can lead to suboptimal management advice .  However, it remains unclear how assessment models should be configured to confront changes in fishery fleet structure and uncertainties in resulting selectivity forms, while balancing complexity-parsimony tradeoffs. Here, a simulation analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of alternative assessment model configurations  when confronted with simulated dynamics representing transitions among gear types (i.e., with different selectivity forms), including variation in the: 1) rates of transition (i.e., a slow or fast transition among gears), and 2) selectivity form for each modeled fleet (e.g., asymptotic or dome-shaped). In general, explicitly modelling fleet structure (i.e., multi-fleet models) performed well, but demonstrated bias when the form of selectivity was mis-specified. In comparison, single-fleet models were only unbiased when time-varying selectivity was estimated to implicitly account for transitions among gear types. Considering parsimony-complexity tradeoffs, our results suggest that single-fleet models are adequate for operational management advice in many cases, but research oriented multi-fleet models should be used as validation tools to explore model consistency.
